# Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Segmentation-for-Telecom
 Customer acquisition and retention is a key concern for many industries, especially acute in the strongly competitive and quick growth telecommunications industry. Meanwhile, since the cost of retaining a good customer is much lower than acquiring a new one, it is very profit-effective to input valuable resource on the Retention Campaign.  Customers churn for various different reasons. Experience tells us that once the customer has made up their mind, retention becomes really hard. Therefore, managing churn in a proactive process is essential for the growth of the customer base and profit.  The primary goal of churn analysis is usually to create a list of contracts that are likely to be cancelled in the near future.  The customers holding these contracts are then targeted with special incentives designed to deter cancellation.  At a more sophisticated level, the telecommunications company attempts to detect the reasons for an expected cancellation, because this information may help customize the offer.
